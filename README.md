# Communities for the Six Kinds
## Scaling your learning graph in 6 steps :rocket:

Coding can be daunting initially. From the variety of blog posts to crash courses on YouTube, not to forget the dozens of advices you get from relatives, finding your path in this world can be quite challenging. Even when one fixes the starting point, staying consistent and faithful without losing confidence is a herculean task.

*What if it could have be simplified further?* **That is what this project aims to do!**
Started as a Mozilla Open Leader Project, Communities for the six kinds (CFT6K) aims to empower individuals and communities round the globe by developing more inclusive structures and planning more engaging activities to further scale the learners crowd. To read more about it, feel free to check out the [Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/fossmec/the-6-kinds-of-people-in-computer-science-and-engineering-4e6dae122ecd), the [video pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3b5REV76qA), a [lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rqhRT6V7Og) or the [presentation deck](https://speakerdeck.com/johnover_board/the-six-kinds-of-people-in-tech-communities) exploring and explaining the idea deeper!

### And if you are here looking to see how to contribute, welcome aboard!! :sparkles: :octocat:
What better way to empower individuals than the collaboratory end result that we can produce together!

To get a clearer picture, feel free to examine the plan in mind:

You can contribute further to the project by one of the following ways:
* **Develop** the website
* **Research** and create content
* **Connect** and share ideas to improve

# There could be a natural question popping in your mind: Why this project? What's unique?
And you are right to think so! What sets us apart is our approach of not reinventing the wheel but rather connecting the dots between existing support system and your needs, by better serving it to you with the model of 6 stages. And with your support, we can make this a one fit for all engine to engage communities round the globe.

As this is a brand new project, even I am trying to figure out ways to design this open. So if you would like to suggest ways to better develop it, feel free to reach out to me via [email](joelvzach@gmail.com). Once we get sufficient people piqued about the mission, we can have a kick-off event via a conference call and start working officially.

Final Note: Issues are always appreciated :smile:
